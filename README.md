"End the Book Embargo against Cuba"

I signed a petition to the Obama Administration to immediately lift the economic embargo against Cuba
as it pertains to books and educational materials.
Cuba's adult literacy rate is among the highest in the world- at 100%!
With Obama recently visting Cuba, the begining of trade, banking, fishing, etc will soon be open
and straight forward.
The Cold War is finally over!!!!
